Hey there ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m Rohit Kadappa Gundakalli, a recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from the University
of Massachusetts Amherst. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in core areas
such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Cloud Systems. I've also gained practical
experience in software development, working on innovative projects and enhancing my technical skills at
Wow Labz Pvt. Ltd. and Ellucian.

During my time at UMass, I specialized in advanced topics like Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement
Learning, and Distributed Systems. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including
Python, Kafka, and AWS, to drive impactful solutions.

Iâ€™m eager to contribute to the tech industry and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of
innovation. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can work together to shape the future of technology!
