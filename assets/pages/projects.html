            <p>Fine-tuned state-of-the-art Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 for multi-label
                classification of quotes. Explored various prompting techniques on T5 and Gemma models to
                enhance the quote interpretation task. Conducted extensive analysis of the results,
                improving
                the accuracy and efficiency of the models. This project showcased my expertise in natural
                language processing and machine learning.</p>

            <p>This repository contains efficient implementations of advanced algorithms explored during the
                COMPSCI611 course, with a focus on optimizing time complexity. The algorithms cover a range
                of
                topics, including sorting (Merge Sort), matrix operations (Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix
                Multiplication), computational geometry (Closest Pair of Points), polynomial operations,
                graph
                theory (Minimum Spanning Trees with Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms, Bipartite Graph
                Matching),
                dynamic programming techniques (Knapsack, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra's), and network flow
                optimization (Ford-Fulkerson). Each implementation demonstrates key concepts in algorithm
                design, such as divide-and-conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming, ensuring
                optimal
                performance.</p>
