            <p>UniThrift is a platform created to support university students in addressing rising living and
                educational expenses. By offering an affordable and sustainable way to buy essential items from fellow
                students, UniThrift promotes second-hand shopping, which aligns with the growing trends of
                sustainability and minimalism. This student-exclusive marketplace allows users to resell books,
                electronics, furniture, and other items, fostering community connections while encouraging eco-friendly
                practices on university campuses. <br>
                <br>
                By focusing on a secure, user-friendly, and sustainable shopping experience, UniThrift streamlines
                buying and selling among verified students, ensuring smooth transactions and trust within the campus
                community. Its backend, powered by FastAPI and MongoDB, delivers a reliable and scalable infrastructure
                hosted on AWS. APIs are accessible via Swagger and Postman, facilitating seamless integration and
                testing. Key features include real-time sales queues, transaction history tracking, and admin analytics
                for a better user experience.

            <p>Fine-tuned state-of-the-art Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 for multi-label
                classification of quotes. Explored various prompting techniques on T5 and Gemma models to
                enhance the quote interpretation task. Conducted extensive analysis of the results,
                improving the accuracy and efficiency of the models. This project showcased my expertise in
                natural language processing and machine learning.</p>

            <p>This repository contains efficient implementations of advanced algorithms explored during the
                COMPSCI611 course, with a focus on optimizing time complexity. The algorithms cover a range
                of topics, including sorting (Merge Sort), matrix operations (Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix
                Multiplication), computational geometry (Closest Pair of Points), polynomial operations,
                graph theory (Minimum Spanning Trees with Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms, Bipartite Graph
                Matching), dynamic programming techniques (Knapsack, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra's), and network flow
                optimization (Ford-Fulkerson). Each implementation demonstrates key concepts in algorithm
                design, such as divide-and-conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming, ensuring
                optimal performance.</p>

            <p>CatchUp is a real-time chat application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
                and WebSockets. The application allows users to register, log in, and chat with other users. It also
                supports image sharing for a more interactive experience.
