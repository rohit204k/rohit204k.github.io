    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹!

        Iâ€™m Rohit Gundakalli, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. With a strong foundation in areas like Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Cloud Systems, I've also gained hands-on experience in software development and project management through my roles at Wow Labz Pvt. Ltd. and Ellucian.
        
        Currently pursuing my Master's, I'm deeply immersed in cutting-edge topics like Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Distributed Systems, aiming to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry's future. My proficiency spans a range of technologies including Python, Kafka, AWS, and more, and I'm always eager to delve into new tools and methodologies. 
        
        Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!
