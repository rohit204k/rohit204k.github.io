      description:
      [
        "This repository contains efficient implementations of advanced algorithms explored during the COMPSCI611 course, with a focus on optimizing time complexity. The algorithms cover a range of topics, including sorting (Merge Sort), matrix operations (Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication), computational geometry (Closest Pair of Points), polynomial operations, graph theory (Minimum Spanning Trees with Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms, Bipartite Graph Matching), dynamic programming techniques (Knapsack, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra's), and network flow optimization (Ford-Fulkerson). Each implementation demonstrates key concepts in algorithm design, such as divide-and-conquer, greedy methods, and dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance."
